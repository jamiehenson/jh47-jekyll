Results time for the A-Levellers is rolling up in a week's time and it got me thinking to this time last year, when I was there, bricking it. It's a heavy point of the education timeline since it determines the next three, four or five (if you're one of those medical types) years of your life and ultimately influences beyond that. That thought certainly hits home then. I've had a year of it, coming through my freshers' year at Bristol with a first, which I was more relieved about than anything. The omniscient 'they' say it always gets harder the second year in, but those I've asked who have just finished their second year haven't always agreed with that point. Granted, there's still a fair learning curve involved I'm sure, it's just that the hill always looks a lot steeper from the bottom. The concept of squaring a number seemed like second-order differential equations in Year 3, but by Year 5, you were the boss.

Anyway, I don't know if anyone will read this, but since I had no actual guidance with what to expect as a first year Computer Scientist, I thought it might help potential freshers if they took it from someone who's just survived their first set of battles. (probably one of the nerdier metaphors I could have used)

Firstly, every University is different. I can guarantee that the social experiences and the teachings I had at Bristol are in varying amounts different to those found at other Unis. One thing I can say about the whole experience when looking back is just how variable and random it actually was! Never again will you be thrown into a new place in a new city with complete strangers like this, and make friends with _all_ of those people (yes, freshers is that manic) and feel like you're living at a second home within a couple of days. Your flatmates really are the luck of the draw. I know close-knit groups where all eight of them are the best of friends and are living together next year. I know of other groups where there are factions of two or three within the flat, or where people are excluded from the clique and hang out with others.

During freshers, there are always two standard questions: 'What is your name?' and 'What course are you doing?'. All is well with your name, you can't really go wrong with the question unless your name is 'creepy guy' or 'douche' but I found that when you say 'Computer Science" in response to the second question, it generally always leads to an awkward dead end in the conversation. I don't really know why. Many have stereotypes for CompScis, or have nothing against them but don't know what to say about the topic. Haven't really found a way around that one, but it soon pales into insignificance when you get to know people more. My advice is though to make the absolute most of freshers, grab it by the horns, because it won't be like that again! During the first term, go out 5 times a week. Do crazy things. It gives you both sides of the coin when you come to lay down your real foundations towards the end of the year. You'll probably learn that that lifestyle isn't sustainable if you want to keep up good grades and sleep (hah, good luck getting the latter!), though I can't speak for everyone with that. I'm not overly fond of clubbing. I'll take a social drink down the pub or a gig any day.

By the time it got to the second term, I had traded my fresher's lifestyle for an uphill slog. Computer Science is hard. Believe that. You are given seemingly gargantuan coursework assignments which seem insurmountably large, and while your friends are out getting smashed after tapping a few words into Microsoft Word for their essay, you're there with your CompSci buddy (I recommend finding one or two in halls, pair, or as they for some reason call _'extreme' _programming works a treat) programming in a language you've only just been introduced to until 5 in the morning. On the other side to that however, several of my modules were entirely coursework based, and so I'd pretty much passed the year by the time I'd got to my exams through marks I already had in the bank. The amount of time spent is largely disproportionate when compared to exam revision (which becomes excruciating come the end, you're desperate to read _anything_ but something that even implies the existence of computers), but sticking at your coursework really is a worthwhile investment. Brushes your programming up too, no end.

Your Uni will have its own suggested reading list, but here's a list of books and resources that really helped me out (brotip - look around your department building for ads from older years selling their books, or search the book title on Google appended with the term 'pdf', you may well find a money-saving solution ;) ):

*   [Introduction to the Theory of Computation, Michael Sipser](http://www.google.co.uk/products/catalog?q=introduction+to+the+theory+of+computation&amp;hl=en&amp;nord=1&amp;prmd=ivnsb&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=1075&amp;ion=1&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;tbm=shop&amp;cid=15331399553508156968&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=DwZETvfwFYm38gPMxb3sBQ&amp;ved=0CE4Q8wIwAA) (essential for the standard Theory module referring to finite state automata, context-free languages and Turing machines, the best out there I've seen)
*   [A Practical Introduction to Computer Architecture, Dan Page](http://www.google.co.uk/products/catalog?q=introduction+to+computer+architecture&amp;hl=en&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;tbm=shop&amp;cid=10153941474696421203&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5QZEToX9FIi3hAe2_bSuCQ&amp;ved=0CFUQ8wIwAQ) (for the lowdown of what's going on inside the computer, this is a cracking resource, actually written by my personal tutor)
*   [Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.co.uk/) (for finding research papers and studies for any history-based module, this is a god-send.
What you may have seen on many reading lists, but don't believe the hype:

*   [ The New Turing Omnibus, A. K. Dewdney](http://www.google.co.uk/products/catalog?q=new+turing+omnibus&amp;hl=en&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;tbm=shop&amp;cid=8508700411336691185&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ugdETsO6LIPDhAfz8PSuCQ&amp;ved=0CEYQ8wIwAA) (jack of all trades, master of none - this book goes over many things, but didn't teach me anything I could fully grasp)
Further down the line, what Uni hits home to you is that there generally is always some sort of group that follows your hobbies. I'm into music, and by the end of the year I'd auditioned for the Uni Big Band, done two musicals (one running over 4 nights), and got involved in my own band. For sport, there is even more - literally everything from judo to American football. It helps to have a refuge from coding by doing something completely different! It also pays to get involved in societies, because Uni gym memberships are often extortionate, and societies can get you out doing things for a subsidised rate. Don't be pressured into doing any society things straight away though, you won't have the time! Just keep it in mind for later.

In terms of the course though, despite the difficulties and long hours I faced, I still maintain that Computer Science is a worthwhile course to do, especially at one of the top Unis, because one of the things that stood out to me most is just how well connected and how knowledgeable your lecturers are - they're pushing ahead in a still moving industry. That's the main thing about CompSci. Maths is maths. Chemistry is chemistry. Those fields are making progress all the time, but at nowhere near the same rate as the field of computing. To think that it practically started (as we know it) in and around the 1930s, and has evolved into what it is now, to me, is astonishing and it's great to be a part of that.

I think I'll wrap this up here, or else I'd be going on for hours. My final words on the whole thing though will probably be: keep an open mind to everything but don't be pressured into doing things you're not comfortable doing, don't fall behind with your work because it'll only require double the effort to get back up, and love every moment.
