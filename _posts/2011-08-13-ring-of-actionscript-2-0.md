Having recently left my part time job at Alton Towers I have been looking for some tasks to keep the brain awake, and so after a slog on Dead Space 2 (playing during the light hours, you wuss) I looked through my course description for next year and found out that MatLab was on the agenda, and also realised that I should brush up on my Java since the main project last year was mainly written by my mate whilst I did the artwork. I also looked into C++, and the comparisons it had with Java.

Wikipedia and forum searches aside I needed a task.

I was at a house party in Manchester recently when the drinking games were brought out, notably the infamous 'Ring of Fire' which requires a deck of cards. We didn't have a deck of cards, so the computer scientist in me (yes, he does linger in the background even at parties) thought it would be good if computers could solve this cornerstone of human strife for us as well. A tipsy search on Google at the time yielded no results, so I had a basis for a small app. The next question begs, which language to use? Doing it in C would have been easy but it would have looked like ass. Besides, cracking out the terminal at parties is likely to get you stared at. I couldn't be bothered to set up an interface using Swing in Java, so I eventually descended on my old friend Flash.

I have the archaic MX version (when it still said Macromedia on the box, fancy that) which I bought back when I was at school. I've always been used to this version, and so I've never really looked into ActionScript 3, and am used to ActionScript 2, which runs a lot slower, apparently. I haven't used Flash in years. I mean years. This hit home to me when the suite creaked into life, trollfaced that it was out of date, and left me helplessly with a blank workspace.

So anyway, after a couple of hours of toil, the below piece of renaissance-esque mastery came out of it. It initially had a card counter but I couldn't get the dynamic fields to update. Man I suck at Flash.

But next time I'm short of a pack of cards, who's laughing then! Nobody probably, but the thought is there. :)
