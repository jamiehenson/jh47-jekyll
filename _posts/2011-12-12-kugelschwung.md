When it comes round to doing something creative for Uni, I'll always jump at the chance to make it as badass as possible. Or, failing that, make it as quirky as possible. I'm not sure which category this fits into!

Kugelschwung translates literally from German to "ball momentum", fitting really because it's all about swinging pendulums - to stifle the sniggers of people imagining testicles flying through the air. The premise was this: a row of 8 (or, 7 in the end, because one broke) dually anchored pendulums, with lasers centrally fixed between them. When the pendulum cuts the laser, a sound is triggered - and weird and wonderful soundscapes ensue (theoretically!)

It was a joint effort between myself and the guys I live with in Bristol (plus Kathryn, who painted the pendulum balls - which were in fact Christmas baubles filled with salt for ballast). I came up with the concept and design, and wrote the interface software to take the readings from the sensors and actually play sounds. Tom did the tricky job in my opinion, he built the entire thing from scratch, from the physical structure to the soldering of the circuitry. Hats off to that man.

Initially, we were aiming to have it as some sort of drum-machine/bass synth hybrid, but after discovering the volatility of the MIDI signals being sent between my interface program and FL Studio (used for the sound making), and the tendency for it to feed back - we abandoned this method for a simpler, and more audibly experimental approach. We decided, on the eve of the performance, to let the unpredictable, hypnotic phasing qualities of the pendulums work in our favour.

Therefore, our final sound setup was to have the program cycle through all of the MIDI patches, with each pendulum playing each note of the C Major scale (which I had preprogrammed in). There was also the functionality to transpose the key on the fly, and manually change the instrument, volume and which lasers were on and off. This was initially a test, but turned out to be so weird, yet intriguing in sound, that we kept it. Thus we donned our terrible German accents in homage to Kraftwerk, and set to it!

Here is a video of our performance, in a darkened room so as to not throw off the laser sensors! Tom is at the computer, operating the program. Ben, Alex and Matt are controlling and regulating the pendulums. I'm playing guitar and putting on a horrendous German accent.
