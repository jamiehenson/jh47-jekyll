I've had my Fender Stratocaster for many years and it's done me well - it was the first electric guitar I bought and I've barely tampered with it, aside from replacing the strings every few months. I didn't see the need. It's a great guitar. Next-level Mexican craftsmanship.

But it looked a little drab. It has an Arctic White finish, so with its maple neck and white pickguard, it all looked rather devoid of colour contrast. So, I picked up a black pickguard off the net and decided to install that, since black is literally as much of a contrast to white as you can get. Here's a picture of it before, with me using it during a Christmas bash:

First step was to take off the old plate. Unlike like Jazz Bass when I took off the cover for a look underneath, the Strat bares all, revealing just how simple they are inside - just a few rustic components wired together. Well, it was designed in the 50s, and the design has done them well so far!

I made sure to keep a close eye on all the screws I removed, since there were quite a few. 11 for the outer rim, 2 for the switch, 6 for the pickups, 3 nuts for the knobs. Below shows my outstanding screw-separating skills, and the stripped guitar covered with a towel at that point to stop the dust from getting in to the components (or rather, to save its dignity!)

It was a fiddly procedure connecting all the parts back to the pickguard (which seems to be the anchor point for all the electronics inside), but due to the lack of tension in the wires, I was able to lift the guard up from different angles as I connected things to maintain clear access.

After a few minutes of hardcore screwing (har-de-har), all the parts were in place and fixed to the board, with the knobs and switchheads reattached also. No real difficulties here, except for adjusting the height of the pickups by tightening the screws (which compressed a rubber dampener the more it was turned, raising the pickup).

Looking better already, but the sound had room for improvement on accounts as it had no strings...

Done! A nice change to the old guitar. While the only changes are superficial, it's amazing how much difference a clean and a polish and a new set of strings can make to an instrument - it feels like new (though not too new, it has those slightly "worn in" qualities). And it only cost me a tenner. Fond memories are restored of when I first bought it, with a super-smooth neck and ringing sustain, and that penetrating Strat-esque "quack".

The question is, what more can be done to it? Answer - endless things, I just don't have the wallet for it. I could replace the pickups with superior single-coils, or I could replace one of them with a humbucker for a thicker sound - changing the sound entirely. I could literally replace anything on it with something better than the stock component, but at the end of the day, if you're going to do that, just buy a new guitar. There's tinkering with the look to make it more unique, and then there's being an anorak. For me, it sounds spot on.
