These days I find myself using Mac more and more for work. Ironic really, since the marketing puts it out as more of an operating system for casual users, and I end up using it for the lowest level programming jobs - because of its UNIX background combined with its ease of use.

Anyway, I found that using my standard Windows keyboard worked well with it, but some of the keys were annoyingly the wrong way round (@ for ", and a number of other annoyances).

<!-- more -->

My flatmate, a more experienced Mac user, made [this custom keyboard layout](http://jh47.com/files/UK.keylayout "Windows keyboard layout for Mac") for a Windows keyboard on Mac, so things are the right way again and balance in the universe is restored. If you find yourself in a similar sitch, this may be useful! (I'm on Mac OSX Lion by the way, but it should work similarly for older versions)

You install it like so:

1.  Copy the _[UK.keylayout](http://jh47.com/files/UK.keylayout)_ file to &lt;name of Mac hard drive&gt;/Library/Keyboard Layouts
2.  Go into System Preferences, and pick Keyboard
3.  Click on "Input Sources"
4.  Scroll to the bottom of the input source list and pick "UK", deselect "show input menu in menu bar" to get rid of the annoying icon at the top.
5.  Go back to Keyboard settings, and click on Modifier Keys
6.  Change Option for Command and Command for Option. Press OK.
Done. Woopah.
