I'm playing bass a lot these days, in venues that differ greatly in size, playing styles of music that also differ equally. Over my time at Uni, my amp setup has changed dramatically. Last year I survived with a Roland Cube 60, a competent guitar amp, but practically useless for bass in a large venue.

Then I brought down my old faithful Ashdown Electric Blue 180 from back home, and found that that too wasn't enough. So I ditched the Ashdown head and bought an Ampeg Portaflex PF500, which is three times more powerful, smaller, lighter, has more features and is generally better all round the board (it was pricey, mind...). But then I found that the 500W (or rather, 300W at 8 ohms) Ampeg was killing my old Ashdown speaker, a 150W rated Ashdown BlueLine. It was fine at the start of a gig, but 20 minutes in, the overall volume and tone would fall away harshly - presumably because the magnet in the speaker overheated and lost its magnetism from the barrage of power it was receiving. So a new speaker was needed too, a messier operation...

I bought anÂ Eminence Deltalite II 2515, similar to what Ampeg cabs have. I got it on the merit that it was much more powerful than the BlueLine, and also a lot lighter (due to the material the magnet is made from).

Here's my amp before the fit. I'd already made some modifications in adding some heavy duty wheels (as having to carry the amp as well as my bass and amp head would just be too much after taking it all around Bristol!), and painting the grill white. The cavity where the old amp was had been empty for a long time. The second picture shows the BlueLine.

First it was a matter of getting the old lad out. Simple enough, you just had to unscrew the 8 fittings holding it in. But, the speaker was on a relatively short leash due to the wire connections it had soldered on to it (old school). I cut these about an inch and a half down from the solder connection to leave a small tag for later use if I wanted to use it again.

Then, time to install the new one. Pictured first below is the new speaker by itself, with the more modern connection (where you screw the wires into place instead of having to get the soldering iron out). To get to the second picture, I didn't have a spare hand to take a photo, but it was a matter of stripping about 1cm of insulation from the old wires, twisting the ends, putting them into the holes in the screw-connectors, and tightening it up.

When screwing the new one in, I made sure to be careful with the screwdriver - slipping and putting it through the cone would not have been good for its health :)

That was it! My first speaker installation was relatively painless, and yielded great results. The new speaker has a far greater range, and can deliver bass so low I could leave my bass plugged into it on top of the washing machine during a fast cycle and get a cracking dubstep bassline out of it. Now the only thing "Ashdown" about it is the logo on the grill.

Probably just as well, since I was gigging with it that night. Having to wheel it across bumpy Bristol and using it in a pretty large art gallery was a decent road test, and it survived!
