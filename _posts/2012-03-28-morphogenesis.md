Today I took myself off to Manchester to see the Alan Turing exhibition at Manchester Museum. It was only a small exhibition, but given that it cost me £6 to get there and back on the train, I didn't see any reason why not! Plus I had a mooch around at the other exhibits, about Mediterranean archaeology and prehistoric birds. I swear I'm a closet history fan.

I knew the odd thing about the man and his work through my course - I studied the life of Turing for a report I wrote last year, and attended a talk by his primary biographer. Plus, the man practically _invented_ my course, and so you can't call yourself a computer scientist if you don't at least have a passing interest in what he did.

What I was surprised to find out when I got to the exhibition was that it was on morphogenesis, a lesser-known and later portion of his work - what he was working on before he took his own life in unfortunate circumstances in 1954.

Notably different from the purely mathematical nature of his earlier work (the highly influential "On Computable Numbers..." from 1936 for instance), morphogenesis relates to the mathematical study of how an organism takes its shape, and how the physical conditions of the environment have an effect. Why coral grows the way it does, why all cows have different patterns, et cetera.

It's pretty fascinating stuff, and I won't pretend to understand what he was talking about, or at least, the maths behind the concepts. As a computer science student I've barely scratched the paint off the theory behind the fundamentals of computation, and even those little flakes of paint are hard to adjust to. This man trailblazed, inventing it with no prior help. I'm reading it out of a book where the concepts have been simplified and simplified again and I'm still scratching my head. Take the image below, a photo of one of his printings I took from today:

What the exhibition highlighted however was how important these particular theories on morphogenesis are in today's world. His theories have never been disproven, and have featured as a strong foundation for later work. He also predicted the work of the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction by a good number of years (not able to see the work due to the tensions between Russia and the West).

People already know about his incredible contributions regarding code-breaking for WW2\. He was already well established as a brilliant mind of his time, and this later work pushed him further forward. But, as a gay man in a time when homosexual relationships were illegal, he was convicted for "serious crimes" and given a course of female hormones over a year to "cure him". They treated him more harshly because he was an educated man and therefore should "know better". The government's backwards, barbaric actions drove him to his own suicide, or so it is believed. It makes me sad knowing what he could have done past the age of 42, when his mind was still in his prime.
