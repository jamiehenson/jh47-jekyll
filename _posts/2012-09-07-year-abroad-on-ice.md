Not literally on ice. I’m not sure if a year of higher education in Computer Science is the best premise for an ice-skating show.

My third year of University is fast approaching, with a little under a month to go, and it has led me to think about the prospect of studying abroad, a number of times. This isn’t a random thought - I was originally set to take my third year out to study abroad, it was one of the main reasons I chose Bristol in the first place. But, around 9 or so months ago I made the conscious decision to pull out of it.

The way I see it, the year abroad is vital, and tailored, for language students. I mean, if you’re studying a particular language, the benefits of immersing yourself in a place that natively speaks it far outweigh reading about it in books, from both a functional and a cultural perspective. But for those taking science, engineering et cetera, can it be equally as beneficial?

I have several friends on my course heading overseas, some there already, and I don’t doubt that they’ll benefit massively from the experience. But me personally, I just didn’t feel ready. I feel that exploring future prospects abroad is something more suited to when you have some more steady academic foundations and professional connections. However, on a different note, this would be the only time when you’d get to experience that new culture from a student’s perspective. You’d meet people you would never otherwise meet, go to places you wouldn’t even hear about at another time. There’s a strong appeal in that.

There were other reasons why I didn’t go through with it: too much degree bias on the final year, I have a nice flat here, highly enjoyable musical commitments, friends. Furthermore, I don’t speak a foreign language (I’ve tended to neglect that path since secondary school, in favour of more technical subjects and music), and so that pretty much rules me out of the ERASMUS scheme. There was a lot less support (financial and otherwise) when going to the States.

These days, I feel like I’m just about settling in. First year was packed with new experiences. Second was about getting to terms with hard graft. Third and fourth, I’m told, are the best years. My current job with the University has shown me a picture of what post-Uni life is like for people in my current position, and I find it rather appealing. In hindsight I’m not sure why I’d disrupt that right now with a year spent in somewhere completely new, despite how great and self-developing it would be. I was set for California, and ultimately got the grades that would have allowed me to go.

It would have been exciting, certainly, and also completely nerve-wracking. But I reckon it’s something to be saved for a few years time. There’s no cause for “what if”s. It’s not like I’ve missed any opportunities, per se. I’ve been to America this year on educational business, and will potentially be going to Munich or Paris next year for a similar purpose.

The world’s a big place, and I’ve got a lot of time to get out into it.
