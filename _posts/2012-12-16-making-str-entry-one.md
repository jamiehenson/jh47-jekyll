This term has been notably different to the ones previously at University, in that there is a far greater degree of freedom - both in terms of what to study, and how we want to study it. This has been great for me so far, as I have been able to chuck out (for now) all of the bone-dry theoretical guff that I hated last year, and instead concentrate on things that a) I’m better at, and b) I’m actually interested in. The main problem with last year was that we all had to study the same stuff, which would be fine if all students were equal in terms of what they are/aren’t good at – but we aren’t. One programme of study can’t cater for everyone.

Anyway, a third of this year is the “Games Project”, a hefty invitation from the department to “go nuts and make something cool”. It’s a fantastic idea, and aside from the Year Abroad programme (that I [never actually went on](http://jh47.com/2012/09/year-abroad-on-ice/)) it’s the reason I came to Bristol. A team of six, over around six months, making a fully-fledged game. Sounds pretty decent.

It very much feels like [last year’s big software project](http://jh47.com/docueasy/), with the training wheels off. I’ve made games before, but only little Flash articles that took at most a day to make, and were made for novelty purposes, on my own. Here, you have to consider **time-management**, and how you **collaborate efficiently** with five other individuals who may potentially be working on the exact same items as you. You have to consider the balance between **imaginative design** and **technical feasibility**, and consider who’s best for each role. You have to **build something that people actually want to play**. It’s rather challenging.

I’m not new to project management, and have slotted into the role several times in the past, but this time I willingly took a step back. Instead I was handed the role of “Creative Director”. What that means, I’m not entirely sure, but so far I’ve been responsible for the majority of the game design, overall look-and-feel, and graphical programming. It’s an all-round experience booster, as I’ve learned more about researching design principles, creating designs and graphical resources, and then implementing them into a functioning prototype.

In terms of prototyping, our choice of game engine has made the whole experience painless. [Unity](http://unity3d.com/) is fantastic. Very drag-and-drop on the surface, with a strong scripting foundation, and the ability to export your game to literally any platform instantly (for a price, justifiably). It stands to become a very powerful and widespread development tool in the near future.

I suppose I’d better introduce the game. It’s called **STR** (at the moment), and it is, essentially, a modern take on the space-based side-scrolling shooter. We initially had it based around the laws of relativity (STR stands for Special Theory of Relativity), but digging deeper into the physics revealed a whole world of stuff that was both inappropriately hard, and also unsuitable for a fast-paced and fun game. We are now investigating further into other cool aspects of physics that we can shoehorn in to our steadily growing prototype – which currently just shows a meat and potatoes shooter with no novel features as such.
