Rocksmith is wonderful for a musician. Whether you're new to the guitar, or well used to it - it manages to teach you a little of something new, in a gratifying manner. My musically-challenged flatmate is learning some bass, and I'm expanding my song knowledge in the process, whilst learning to be a little more precise. And as a technoboff I applaud the groundbreaking technology behind it, because it works flawlessly.

But it's never likely to appeal to the masses as much as the toy-like Rock Band and Guitar Hero games, simply because Rocksmith isn't really a party game, and the controllers are quite expensive. The main drawback for me however, was that the choice of songs is rather small, and there is a lot of "filler" in the roster. Some classics, but a large number of tunes I'd never heard of, and have no interest in learning. There's DLC, but it's very expensive, coming in at around £2.50 a track.

However, I found that you can add your own tunes, relatively easily. It's not trivial, but it's not that taxing - it just needs a little time for inevitable trial and error. But you're rewarded with a personalised song library, at no extra cost - and all of a sudden, it is a party game.

I won't copy out word for word someone else's work, so I'll refer you to this rather excellent [tutorial](http://www.smithyanvil.com/RocksmithCustomGuide.html). It requires a little bit of prior preparation though, so I'll fill you in on that.

In terms of the most important stuff, all you need is the original song (in MP3 or OGG format, a good converter is [here](http://www.pcfreetime.com/)), version 1.8 or above of the ["Editor on Fire" software](http://www.fretsonfire.net/forums/viewtopic.php?t=50698), the latest version of the [Rocksmith GUI toolkit](http://code.google.com/p/rocksmith-custom-song-creator/), and the free [WWise audio software](http://www.audiokinetic.com/en/downloads). It helps to have Guitar Pro (used in the tutorial to import the correct "tab" form of the track), but [TuxGuitar](http://tuxguitar.herac.com.ar/) will do just as well. For the .dds file used as album art in game, you can use the free [Paint.NET software](http://www.getpaint.net/).

Things to consider for a Rocksmith track:

*   <span style="line-height: 13px;">You'll need a few seconds of leading silence to help the player out. There's a tool for this in the Editor on Fire software.</span>
*   You'll need to add sections (Intro, Verse, etc) so that the song will actually end, in the game. Again, this is provided in the Editor on Fire software.
*   If you have time, provide different difficulties for your track in the Editor on Fire software. Otherwise, you'll be stuck at max difficulty - not so good for new players.
*   To be recognised in-game inside Steam, you'll need your own personal DLC key (a six figure number). Search around on Google for how to do this, but you can use the Rocksmith GUI Toolkit software to unpack a DLC you've bought, to obtain this number.
Before attempting, you should probably know a little about:

*   <span style="line-height: 13px;">Making and editing MIDI files</span>
*   How to play the guitar itself (to ensure that your in-game tab is accurate/feasible)
*   General knowledge of Digital Audio Workstations (big music software packages like FL Studio or Cubase)
*   Graphic creation
*   General Windows file management
Good luck!
