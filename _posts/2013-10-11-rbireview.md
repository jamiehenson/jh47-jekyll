<span style="color: #111111;"><span style="font-family: verdana, arial;"><span>The paper begins by introducing the concept of RBI (Reality-based Interfaces), and posing it as an umbrella term for the next (or indeed, emerging current) wave of interactive devices </span></span></span><span style="color: #111111;"><span style="font-family: verdana, arial;"><span>which are expanding into the physical world via advancements in technology and the incorporation of more advanced human psychology</span></span></span><span style="color: #111111;"><span style="font-family: verdana, arial;"><span>. By the authors' own admission, this is but a descriptive term and proposes no specific technological or scientific advancements as such, but instead aims to provide a structural foundation for a whole host of diverging interactive paradigms – much like with the term HCI (Human-Computer interaction).</span></span></span>

<span style="color: #111111;"><span style="font-family: verdana, arial;"><span>RBI is described as consisting of four main components:</span></span></span>

*   <span style="color: #111111;"><span style="font-family: verdana, arial;"><span>**Naive Physics (NP)** – the user's understanding of basic physical concepts such as gravity and inertia, and how these concepts can be applied to virtual entities.</span></span></span>
*   <span style="color: #111111;"><span style="font-family: verdana, arial;"><span>**Body Awareness and Skills (BAS)** – the user's subconscious awareness of their own bodies (proprioception), and how the complexity of interaction techniques can be increased to better serve the advanced dexterity and awareness of humans when it comes to their own bodies.</span></span></span>
*   <span style="color: #111111;"><span style="font-family: verdana, arial;"><span>**Environmental Awareness and Skills (EAS)** – the user's perception of the environment around them, whether that be of a set of entities relating to a specific task, or of entities in the periphery.</span></span></span>
*   <span style="color: #111111;"><span style="font-family: verdana, arial;"><span>**Social Awareness and Skills (SAS)** –</span></span></span><span style="color: #111111;"><span style="font-family: verdana, arial;"><span> including the user's verbal or non-verbal interaction with another user into the core functionality of the application.</span></span></span>

<span style="color: #111111;"><span style="font-family: verdana, arial;"><span>The authors provide numerous examples of where these principles have already been applied and discussed in recent published works, but not referred to under any sort of connected field such as the proposed "RBI". These examples include "Engine-Info" an educational tool that combines BAS and EAS that informs users about the part of an engine they are directly looking at, and "Collectibles", a physical social network (heavily referencing SAS) that relies on the physical exchange of messages and gifts, much like in real life. </span></span></span>

<span style="color: #111111;"><span style="font-family: verdana, arial;"><span>Furthermore, one can also include a recent University of Bristol project here – the University of Local Knowledge [</span></span></span><span style="color: #111111;"><span style="font-family: verdana, arial;"><span>1</span></span></span><span style="color: #111111;"><span style="font-family: verdana, arial;"><span>] </span></span></span><span style="color: #111111;"><span style="font-family: verdana, arial;"><span>is an educational social network that aims to share local knowledge of the Bristol community of Knowle West through the medium of video – much like a private YouTube. While this isn't RBI-based in itself, there was a proposed feature of the project that included physical objects being placed around the community, which residents would interact with and use to share items with each other.</span></span></span>

<span style="color: #111111;"><span style="font-family: verdana, arial;"><span>In summary, the authors ably demonstrate that there is indeed an active and growing market for what RBI is looking to wrap around. But </span></span></span><span style="color: #111111;"><span style="font-family: verdana, arial;"><span>considering this</span></span></span><span style="color: #111111;"><span style="font-family: verdana, arial;"><span>, one must ask whether or not </span></span></span><span style="color: #111111;"><span style="font-family: verdana, arial;"><span>an</span></span></span><span style="color: #111111;"><span style="font-family: verdana, arial;"><span> RBI grouping term is required at all? The authors have shown </span></span></span><span style="color: #111111;"><span style="font-family: verdana, arial;"><span>here </span></span></span><span style="color: #111111;"><span style="font-family: verdana, arial;"><span>that the fields are progressing </span></span></span><span style="color: #111111;"><span style="font-family: verdana, arial;"><span>healthily </span></span></span><span style="color: #111111;"><span style="font-family: verdana, arial;"><span>by themselves, </span></span></span><span style="color: #111111;"><span style="font-family: verdana, arial;"><span>and so one viewpoint could be that this paper adds nothing useful, but is merely an attempt for the authors to credit themselves as the founders of a sole field by simply combining several others.</span></span></span>

<span style="color: #111111;"><span style="font-family: verdana, arial;"><span>However, this viewpoint of self-oriented land-grabbing dissolves somewhat as the authors go on to discuss several considerations for the regulation of realistic features. As well as the four core principles of RBI, the authors give six computer-oriented features that must be upheld so that the functional aspects of the interface are not damaged. These features form an opposing side to the four RBI features:</span></span></span>

*   <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: verdana, arial;"><span><span style="color: #111111;"><span style="font-family: verdana, arial;"><span>**Expressive power (functionality)** – Fully realistic modelled environments can restrict the "power" of a program, by restricting the user from using more direct computer commands.</span></span></span></span></span></span>
*   <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: verdana, arial;"><span>**Efficiency** – Expert users often rely on keyboard short-cuts to increase their workflow, and so while a realistic tangible interface is useful for intuitively educating a new user, experienced users may be inconvenienced.</span></span></span>
*   <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: verdana, arial;"><span>**Versatility** – realistic interfaces, due to their greater grounding in real-world physics and interaction principles, are inherently less versatile than a WIMP interface.</span></span></span>
*   <span><span>**Ergonomics**<span style="color: #000000;"> – realistic interfaces are generally more physically demanding to use than a standard WIMP interface, as they often require a greater degree of physical interaction, such as the </span>mimicking<span style="color: #000000;"> of actual human movement.</span></span></span>
*   <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: verdana, arial;"><span>**Accessibility** – Another side effect of the previous point, the need for more physical interaction means that those with physical disabilities may not be able to fully interact with a system.</span></span></span>
*   <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: verdana, arial;"><span>**Practicality** – </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: verdana, arial;"><span>Whereas WIMP interfaces are purely abstract and screen-based, a realistic interface often has a bespoke hardware component which greatly increases the cost and size of a RBI-based system (in most cases). One has to also consider the durability of an interface which you physically interact with.</span></span></span>

<span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: verdana, arial;"><span>The authors state that as many of the four core principles must be upheld as possible, but in a case where they cannot, then one of the six classical principles must be upheld in its place, as a direct trade-off. They essentially propose a balance between the two sides, with a heavier skew (if possible) towards the RBI end.</span></span></span>

<span style="color: #111111;"><span style="font-family: verdana, arial;"><span>Thus, RBI may just be what's required right now, to tie together a whole load of divergent streams of research before they diverge too far and start to conflict with each other – which would damage the entire field of interactive design. </span></span></span><span style="color: #111111;"><span style="font-family: verdana, arial;"><span>The regulations and design considerations proposed here can only benefit the current streams of realistically-inspired interfaces, even if they are just points of reference instead of the commandments of a new super-field.</span></span></span>
