The previous two posts on this blog are brief reviews of two papers that have become an important part of the preliminary research for my Interactive Devices unit at University. After I had a clearer picture of the field of Interactive Devices and surrounding areas, it was time to take a step forward and start discussing potential project ideas with my group - which consists of Ben Collins and James Vine, as well as myself.

As a group, we all have a leaning towards musical interfaces, with Ben and I having experience in [publishing a paper](http://www.eecs.umich.edu/nime2012/Proceedings/papers/131_Final_Manuscript.pdf "Kugelschwung") in the area, and James and I being members of several musical groups around Bristol, performing music in a variety of styles. Therefore, despite working individually at the start of the brainstorming session to form the ideas shown in the image below, all of the ideas had a musical grounding.

My contributions to the initial ideas-gathering were as follows:

*   "Automated drummer based on environmental noise"
*   "Dancing drummer app for smart-phones"
*   "Drum-to-synth instrument, using vibrations as input"
*   "Eye-controlled instrument"
*   "Kinect-based guitar effects pedal"
*   "Water flow-based instrument"
*   "Light/fog-based interactive instrument"

The latter two were selected by the group, and refined further, with the "water flow" one evolving into the "Waves II Waves" idea further outlined in the next post, and the "light/fog" one ending up as a runner-up to the final two. The "light/fog" idea, while appealing at first, could not be broken down any further from a vague concept, and so it was discarded to make way for more concrete ideas.

All in all, the brainstorming session was very productive, with the group going from having no pre-conceived ideas whatsoever to having two strong candidate plans for our project topic. The structured environment enforced by the lecturers and post-doctoral assistants also increased productivity over a short time-scale, by assigning short and regular time deadlines to encourage quick thinking, and by discouraging the critical feedback of ideas until each member of the group had contributed a large bank of unpolished ideas.

To conclude, we are in a good position now to think more about what we need to do to put these ideas into motion - what hardware we need, how things are going to work from a software perspective, and most importantly what ambitious goals to aim for. In the next instalment here, more information will be provided about the final two ideas: "Waves II Waves" and "Tangible Speaker".
