As mentioned in the previous post, we narrowed ~30 unrefined project ideas down to two, and then during Tuesday’s lab session, narrowed that number down further to one final idea - whilst also further expanding the project definition.

<!-- more -->

Of the two ideas originally proposed, we have opted to focus on **Waves To Waves** as our final project basis. To summarise, Waves To Waves is a musical interface that interprets the movement of water, and outputs sound and visuals directly relating to this motion. Below is a diagram detailing the proposed physical construction for the interface:

A row of buoyant balls (the row consisting of 10 balls above, though this number hasn't been finalised) is suspended using fishing line above a transparent tank of water. The balls, fixated to fishing line (yet allowed to move up and down it), are equally spaced along the width of the tank, and the strings they are fixed to are anchored to the bottom using water-resistant tape - thus restricting the movement of the balls to one plane of movement (up and down).

We then monitor the vertical movement of these balls when the water is disturbed, using a Kinect facing the tank from the side, to determine the wave motion of the water inside the tank. We can then take this information and use it to generate audio cues to be fed into a software synthesiser, and following that, a visualisation generator, which feeds visual content to a pico projector mounted under the tank, pointing upwards.

Whilst the key items we require are labelled on the diagram above, below is a list of the equipment that we require for this project. The items in bold are ones that we would ideally like the department to provide:

Equipment list:

*   **Microsoft Kinect**

*   Buoyant objects (balls)

*   Clear-sided tank with leg supports

*   Fishing line

*   Waterproof tape

*   **Pico projector**

*   Ball mount rail

*   Computer (most likely a laptop due to the extra connectivity and increased performance required to process the music and visuals)
