**1\. Tangible Sound: Musical Instrument Using Fluid Water (ICMC2000)**

This paper is an example of a previous instrument built that uses water to create music. Our proposal takes a different slant to using water, but it is still interesting to see the author’s reasons for creating music from water.

**2\. Pendulum Music**

A piece of music written to harness the natural swings of a pendulum – water waves should create a similar effect.

S. Reich. Pendulum music. In Writings About Music, pages 12-13\. 1974.

**3\. Sound-Wave**

A piece of music written to be played by a giant wave pool. Almost a reverse of our proposal, since the music was written for the water rather than water being used for music.

**4\. Wave Organ**

An experiment taking a harbour in San Francisco and making music from the natural flows of the waves.

**5\. Herzfassen (CHI ‘12)**

This is about taking a pool of water and creating a heartbeat simulation – some of the techniques covered may be useful if we wish to automate the creation of waves in our instrument.

**6\. Water, Temperature and Proximity Sensing for a Mixed Reality Art Installation (ITESM-CEM)**

This is a great example of the usage of water in creating an art installation, including sections on detecting where a user is making contact with the water.

**7\. Kugelschwung (NIME 2012)**

An instrument that was built with the intention of taking a natural motion (in this case, the swing of a pendulum) and converting it into music. A similar approach will be required for our proposal.

**8\. Using water as interface media in VR applications**

This paper investigates interacting with water in different ways to create tangible user interfaces. Specifically the section measuring/creating waves will be particularly relevant.

**9\. User-interfaces based on the water-hammer effect: water-hammer piano as an interactive percussion surface**

This paper describes a musical instrument allowing the user to interact with both the surface and deeper volume of the water, exploiting the water hammer effect commonly found in domestic plumbing.

**10\. Study on Design of Controllable Particle Display Using Water Drops Suitable for Light Environment**

This paper describes a display created by projecting images onto planes of water vapour to create a controllable display. Parts of this paper could be relevant for the visualisation part of the project.

**11\. AquaTop Display: A true ”immersive” water display system**

Water surface display for interacting with content in the bath or other watery situations.

This paper and the next explain AquaTop- a water surface display system. A Kinect records a user’s hand position in the water and relevant visuals are projected onto the surface to create interactive water surface. These papers will be useful for both the image processing and visual projection sides of the project. The interface also uses translucent water which may be interesting to investigate for Waves to Waves.
