We've been at the point now for a while where the interface itself has been complete (in a physical sense, at least), and any additional changes made have been to the software side of things. Pure Data is notoriously open-ended, and so we've been experimenting with many things to make the interface both more responsive and more capable in terms of what it can actually do. Over the last week, James and I concentrated on the musical side of things, whereas Ben concentrated on the paper - providing us with a complete first draft over the course of this week.

As mentioned in the last post, we transferred from using the absolute readings from the water sensors, to calculating the rate of change - for a more robust result. Due to the success and precision of this method, we decided to remove the six metronomes that previously drove the synthesiser - introduced to counteract the MIDI feedback that arose from having six continually firing inputs. This meant that the response was truly live, instead of having to adhere to slow metronomic cycles. Furthermore, we also experimented with using second-order differentials instead of first-order differentials, which produced a more harshly-decaying sound, but also one that was generally less responsive overall. Thus, we reverted back to using first-order differentials.

Progress came along well, but after a while, we agreed that we were just making changes for change's sake, and that any alterations we made weren't enhancing the device, they were just changing it - and so we were just going around in circles. Also, we found that some of the major barriers we encountered were as a result of the limitations of the equipment (most notably the inexpensive water sensors), so concluded that certain issues were beyond our control. Thus, we chose to draw a line under it.

Once we were happy with how the device performed, James and I turned our attention to the performance side of things. While a cosmetic extra, due to the expressive nature of our project we wanted to ensure that we presented it in a memorable way - as it is an instrument of musical expression. There are three members in the group, and so we wanted to involve all members in the performance, instead of having just one of us play Waves To Waves while the other two watched. After a bit of rehearsal, this involvement includes Ben playing Waves To Waves, and James and myself playing ordinary keyboard synthesisers as a backing - showing how Waves To Waves can be used alongside conventional instruments to make music.
