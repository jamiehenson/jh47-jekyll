Yesterday, we presented Waves To Waves to our peers and lecturers - demonstrating the culmination of our two months of work on the project:

Below is some footage of us performing, using two keyboard synthesisers to accompany Waves To Waves for a light-hearted rendition of "Chariots of Fire":

With a draft of our paper already written, today we worked on the video - shooting the footage, recording the voice-overs, and starting on the editing process. Tomorrow, we hope to have the video completed, and soon we hope to have the final version of the paper ready as well - as soon as we receive feedback from external sources.
