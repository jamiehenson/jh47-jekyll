Tonight is when the circle completes.

Three years ago, I was a naive fresher, attending his hall's Christmas Formal. I had enjoyed the day, photographing the snowy grounds, relishing the tense excitement of the buildup to Christmas. It had been a great term, with a lot of new people, a lot of new things - and not a lot of sleep. Looking back with an older head, I realise that I could have done some things differently. I made childish decisions. But we all did. We were essentially children, released into an adult world.

I digress. I go to the Formal, sitting on the JCR table. I had gotten in to the JCR in late October, keen to get involved after my time as student president in college. I enjoyed the meal, the company, the magician I had spent seemingly weeks trying to book, and then the entertainment came on. It was a rather large jazz band called The Hornstars.

I started like the rest of the guests, dancing and bopping along reservedly to the music. But after a short while I stood, relatively lifeless on the front row, watching the band intently. I was mesmerised. From watching the bass player rip into I Wish, to watching one of the sax players lurch forwards and snog someone on the front row (not me, thankfully) after an incredible solo, something clicked inside. This is what I want to do. This is a thing I want to be a part of. When you arrive at University, you are like a clockwork car, released - full of energy, yet directionless. But I had found a goal to work towards. I had naively applied for the band at the start of term, wrongfully believing that Hornstars would be somewhat like my college jazz band and that my complete lack of musical theory would be enough - it wasn't. I realised I had to massively step up my game.

In second year, after a summer of musical study, I tried again and was successful in getting into BUJO, the largely un-auditioned cousin of Hornstars, on bass. In third year I held my position. After a long musical journey, consisting of a rock trio, musicals, time in a dubstep band, and BUJO, finally, now, in the last year of my degree here at Bristol, I have made it into Hornstars. I am the guy ripping into I Wish. And tonight I am playing the very same venue, for the very same event that blew my mind three years ago. There's something very warming about it, yet also conclusive. I have achieved my aims, my dream since the start of University. But also, this marks the end, as this is my final year. Completing a circle means you revisit the point of origin, and so it will bring back memories tonight, of a time that I am rather fond of. Except this time, there is nothing to taint the occasion.

I love Goldney. It took me from a time of complete adolescence and inexperience, and dragged me into the adult world. If I could go back, with the head on my shoulders now, I would squeeze every single opportunity I could for every drop. But I can't. And that's the beauty of experience and hindsight. I don't regret first year though. I loved it. I really did. I just wish that it had carried forward more successfully into the following two. Years two and three were the less interesting middle chapters of the series, building up to something else. But that's the realistic truth of first year, it's a bubble. It's a utopian halfway-house between school and real University life.

I lose sight of where I am now. I compare images of me playing to the packed O2 Academy last week, to images of me playing at a primary school in rural Staffordshire in 2010\. Bristol has made this happen. And so, I maintain that University isn't merely a vehicle for helping you achieve a qualification. It is your passport to achievement and fulfilment all round, not just in an academic sense.

I will never forget these years, or this city.
