  Alright there, I'm Jamie. I'm a recent Computer Science Masters grad from the
  University of Bristol, and am currently working for Caring.com in San Mateo, CA.
  Living in and loving San Francisco.
</p>

<p>
  I have experience with both the front-end and the back-end sides of the coin
  but I prefer the creativity that front-end web development provides - Haml,
  SASS and CoffeeScript are my daily bread. While less critical to my work, I
  have a lot of experience in musical programming - having built a
  <a href="https://github.com/jamiehenson/SeePlay" target='_blank'>visually-driven
  algorithmic composer</a> and a
  <a href="http://wwweb.eecs.umich.edu/nime2012/Proceedings/papers/131_Final_Manuscript.pdf" target="_blank">
  laser pendulum harp</a>.
</p>

<p>
  When not trying to convince computers to do my bidding, I'm a keen (and at
  times semi-professional) musician specialising in jazz bass, though I play
  guitar, drums and piano as well. When I get time off I'm usually writing and
  recording some tune or other. I also love games, and spend a good amount
  of time both playing and developing them.
