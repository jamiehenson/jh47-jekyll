Alright there, I'm Jamie. I'm a recent Computer Science Masters grad from the University of Bristol, and after spending just over a year in San Francisco absorbing their technological wizardry I'm now based as a self-employed software developer in London.

I have several years experience as a full-stack web developer, but I prefer the creativity that front-end development provides - Haml, SASS and CoffeeScript are my daily bread. While less critical to my work, I have a lot of experience in musical programming and interfaces - having built a [visually-driven algorithmic composer](https://github.com/jamiehenson/SeePlay) and a [laser pendulum harp](http://wwweb.eecs.umich.edu/nime2012/Proceedings/papers/131_Final_Manuscript.pdf).

When not trying to convince computers to do my bidding, I'm a keen (and at times semi-professional) musician specialising in jazz bass, though I play guitar, drums and piano as well. When I get time off I'm usually writing and recording some tune or other. I also love games, and spend a good amount of time both playing and developing them.
